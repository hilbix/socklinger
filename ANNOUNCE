Version with options.

This slowly now moves to commandline arguments.  Old commandline still
is supported if no options are present.

To force the new behavior use option -s.
With -s (or -n0) you can do a single accept() call now.

Again beware:

'-n0 :port' is not the same as '0@:port', the latter loops!
Use '-n1 :port' to get a loop.
However this sets SOCKLINGER_NR=1.

So with the new behavior if you see SOCKLINGER_NR<1 you know, it's a single-shot.
