Bugfix, alternate fork method (fix for CygWin) and connect method.

This version is only tested a little bit.

Preforking does not work under CygWin.  So fork on demand is implemented
now, too.  If you give a negative fork count, you can use this method under
Unix as well.

Additionally a "connect" method now is implemented, such that you can run a
script after connecting to the destination.  The syntax is
"source>destination" where source can be empty which does not bind to a specific interface.
If you give no @ only a single connect is done.  Else the connects are done in loops
(according to preforking or postforking based on the number given).

There is no good connect timeout yet.  However system connect timeout shall be there anyway.
