Options -q (quiet) -v (verbose) and -l (linger timeout) -m (max linger)

Now you can control the lingering process better with setting a
timeout and maximum amount of data to read.  The default (0:unlimited)
is somewhat unsuitable for most(!) situations, however it is
impossible to give a better default value.  So if you have a lot of
"hanging" processes in socklinger, try option -l.
