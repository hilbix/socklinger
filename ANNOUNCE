Improved alarm/delay handling (perhaps a bugfix).

The improvements are only in tinolib, but they are significant.  On a
very old Linux distro option -d did not work, as this platform blocks
some signals.  This now is compensated, as flags of used signals are
now set to sane values before using them.
