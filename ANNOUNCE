Version with options.

This slowly now moves to commandline arguments.  Old commandline still
is supported if no options are present.

To force the new behavior use option -s.
With -s (or -n0) you can do a single accept() call now.

Again beware:

'-n0 :port' is not the same as '0@:port', the latter loops!
Use '-n1 :port' to get a loop.
However this sets SOCKLINGER_NR=1.

So with the new behavior if you see SOCKLINGER_NR<1 you know, it's a single-shot.

New option -d (for delay) means that fork()s are delayed as follows:

Preforking (option -n >0): A child sleeps the given seconds after the
connection terminated (after the linger).  To spread the values, the
initial fork()ing is delayed as given, too.  (Note that preforking is
not available for accept-mode under CygWin.)

Postforking (option -n <0): After a fork delay() seconds must elaps
before another new fork is done.  If a child returns in this time,
fork() is available immediately again.
