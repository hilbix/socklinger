Option -d (for delay) added

Delay means that fork()s are delayed as follows:

Preforking (option -n >0): A child sleeps the given seconds after the
connection terminated (after the linger).  To spread the values, the
initial fork()ing is delayed as given, too.  (Note that preforking is
not available for accept-mode under CygWin.)

Postforking (option -n <0): After a fork delay() seconds must elaps
before another new fork is done.  If a child returns in this time,
fork() is available immediately again.
