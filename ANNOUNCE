Script sockets implemented, Options -f -t -w.

All are somewhat experimental.

If the socket starts with a pipe character (|) it now is a program to execute.
This allows two scripts to talk to each other, like in
<pre>socklinger -v "|bash -c 'while read a; do echo \"\$a\" >&2; done'" bash -c 'echo hello world'</pre>

Option -f is thought to change the FD on which the socket is handed to the script.

Option -t gives an upper bound to the connect timeout.  This only works on connect mode.

Option -w limits the lingering to a maximum time.
This is in contrast to -l which restarts on data received.
