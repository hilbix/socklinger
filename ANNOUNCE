SUID now supported.  Now is based on tinolib.

Socklinger now gives up elevated privileges (SUID) before it runs the
script, such that you can bind to system ports.  All you need is to
install it SUID root (and only give the users access to it who are
allowed to wait on system ports).

This version has not been tested much.
