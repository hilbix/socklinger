Additional environment variable and Portcullis script.

Now socklinger sets SOCKLINGER_SOCK to the socketname (from commandline).
The child's return status is processed and printed correctly now.

Also there is now the Portcullis script in example.sh which can be
used to protect system services against intruders.  It's very simple:

Just start it with a password script and a service to invoke.
For example:
<pre>
/usr/local/bin/socklinger 10@:23 /usr/local/sbin/portcullis.sh '[ .127.0.0.1 = ".$IP" ] || echo Password' /usr/sbin/sshd -i
</pre>

This invokes sshd on the telnet port in case the connection is from localhost.
If you are from another host, you first must telnet in and enter the password
(which here is 'Password' for obvious reasons).
