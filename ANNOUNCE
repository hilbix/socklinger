Script sockets implemented, Option -f.

Both are somewhat experimental.

If the socket starts with a pipe character (|) it now is a program to execute.
This allows two scripts to talk to each other, like in
<pre>socklinger -v "|bash -c 'while read a; do echo \"\$a\" >&2; done'" bash -c 'echo hello world'</pre>
