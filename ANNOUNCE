bugfix release and some improvements

You can give it a HUP to gracefully abort.  This means, it exits the
accept()-loop if it's waiting, but it's not going away until
application returns.

accept() can return an error if everything is OK.  In this case
socklinger broke.

Also I tried to resolve the SO_REUSEADDR problem, where you cannot
restart socklinger when there still is one running.  However, it still
does not work.

This version was not been tested much.
