Option -r added

Postforking now even more usable with the new option -r and the two
environment variables SOCKLINGER_COUNT and SOCKLINGER_MAX.  This is to
be able to do statistics and cleanups to notekeeping.

When forks are guaranteed to be slow (or with a high delay setting)
such that there cannot be any race condition, then you can use the
environment variables to do the cleanup.

On a high fork frequency you can use option -r, such that the process
slots are cycled.  As each slot then is visited in a round robin
fashion, you can do the notekeeping (and possible cleanups) at the
beginning.
