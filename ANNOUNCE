Options -p and -u added for timestamping,
new environment variables SOCKLINGER_NOW and SOCKLINGER_PID,
now installs into /usr/local/bin

SOCKLINGER_PID is when you need to kill the outer loop for some
reason, like security issues.  Try following at your own risk:
<pre>#!/bin/bash
[ -n "$SOCKLINGER_PID" ] || exec env -i /usr/local/bin/socklinger -n -5 :12345 "$0"</pre>

Also source update to latest library changes
