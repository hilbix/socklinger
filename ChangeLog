2007-05-08    <tino@firebird.03.softkill.net>

	* socklinger.c (socklinger): better lingering and shutdown now
	from tinolib
	(vnote): added to better generalize routines
	(socklinger_error): moved to top

2007-04-29    <tino@firebird.03.softkill.net>

	* socklinger.c (main): SIGCHLD now is delivered to the process and
	more commandline parameters

2007-04-04    <tino@firebird.03.softkill.net>

	* socklinger.c (process_args): future options prepared

	* example/tester.sh: improved output for tests

	* socklinger.c (socklinger_postfork): cosmetics: again typo in PID
	printing removed (now in waitchild) and SOCKLINGER_NR was 0..n-1,
	correct to 1..n (now based on child_findfree).
	(socklinger_dosock): sleep replaced by tino_relax()
	(socklinger_error): added for support of option -1
	(socklinger_child_findfree, socklinger_waitchild)
	(socklinger_forkchild): added as generalized parts for pre- and
	postfork
	(socklinger_prefork, socklinger_postfork): changed to use new
	routines (which support ignerr)
	(socklinger_forkchild): set dodelay only if delay is active

2007-04-03    <tino@firebird.03.softkill.net>

	* socklinger.c (socklinger_postfork, socklinger_prefork): delay
	added (now in waitchild())

2007-04-02    <tino@firebird.03.softkill.net>

	* socklinger.c (process_args): delay added

2006-12-12    <tino@firebird.03.softkill.net>

	* BUGS: updated

	* diet: Softlink deleted, no "make static"

	* Makefile.tino: re-created with tino/setuptino.sh

	* example/portcullis.sh: completed (hopefully)

2006-09-16  U-KOSH\Administrator  <Administrator@KOSH>

	* socklinger.c (main): bugfix: if @ was missing (like in IPs), cnt
	was set.

2006-09-08  U-KOSH\Administrator  <Administrator@KOSH>

	* socklinger.c (socklinger_prefork, socklinger_postfork): added as
	CygWin fix.  Change usage such, that '-n@' gives alternate fork
	method and '>' creates the connect variant.
	
2006-06-17    <tino@firebird.03.softkill.net>

	* socklinger.c (socklinger): SOCKLINGER_SOCK added to environment
	(socklinger): Now correct exist status is printed

2006-02-09    <tino@firebird.03.softkill.net>

	* socklinger.c (socklinger): close socket on forked connection
	(main): additional socket close here, too.

2006-01-25    <tino@firebird.03.softkill.net>

	* socklinger.c (socklinger_accept): HUP control added

2006-01-24    <tino@firebird.03.softkill.net>

	* socklinger.c (socklinger_accept): If SYN/RST was found or
	something similar weird happened, then accept returns "broken
	pipe" and socklinger got an error.  Now the process relaxes a
	little bit and retries.
	(socklinger): whoopsie, errno was checked even if there was no
	error ..

2005-10-30    <tino@firebird.03.softkill.net>

	* socklinger.c (socklinger): improved output to screen

	* example/streamgrab.sh: added

	* example/tester.sh: improved to give more info

2005-03-15    <tino@firebird.03.softkill.net>

	* socklinger.c (socklinger): fo now specially treated if fo!=fi

2004-08-16  U-KOSH\Administrator  <Administrator@KOSH>

	* socklinger.c (socklinger_accept, main): prefix "count@" for
	number of parallel connections implemented.  It looks like it is
	preforking, but the script isn't preforking at all.  Socklinger
	terminates as soon as any child comes back, but the running childs
	are not terminated yet by force.
