Known bugs:

No way to accept N connections and then terminate
=================================================

Leave this to a real command line.

This then shall define grace periods, that is,
"N connections per second" or
"N seconds sleeps between connections".
And this shall be honored by accept() and connect().


No real commandline
===================

Socklinger shall allow some better commandline.
This here is far from beeing intuitive.


Missing Reader/Writer loop.
===========================

I found some problems with shutdown().

When the remote uses shutdown() on a unix pipe, the stdin is not
closed properly.  This might be due to the fact, that more than one
process keeps open the socket.

The idea now is as follows:

Let socklinger handle the reading portion of the socket.  Give the
process the writing portion of the socket on stdout.  Actively
transport the data from the input to the process until the process
closes down it's input.  Then do the lingering until the socket
closess down.

If the process terminates, shutdown the writing side, as it is done
today.

The process then has no chance to close down the reading side.  But
that's exactly what socklinger is thought for, to *not* let handle the
input to the underlying application.

However, in case that the remote shuts down the output side, such that
at socklinger the input side of the socket is closed, this can be
easily indicated to the application by closing the pipe (or
socketpair) to stdin.

Well .. leave this to the next generation of this tool.
